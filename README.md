## What is SecureShare?

SecureShare is a desktop application for **securely sharing files across a local network (LAN)**.  
Every file is encrypted before transmission using industry-standard cryptography — no plaintext ever leaves your machine.

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| 🔒 File Encryption | AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2-derived keys (260,000 iterations) |
| 🔑 Key Exchange | RSA-2048 (OAEP) — each user has a unique key pair |
| 📁 Folder Encryption | Entire folders archived and encrypted as a single blob |
| ✅ Integrity Verification | SHA-256 hash stored alongside every encrypted file |
| 🌐 LAN Discovery | Automatic subnet scan to find peers running SecureShare |
| 📤 File Transfer | Direct peer-to-peer transfer via embedded Flask server |
| 👥 Multi-Recipient | Encrypt one file for multiple users simultaneously |
| 🛡️ Admin Panel | User management, key regeneration, encrypted backup/restore |
| 🔄 Key Rotation | Regenerate your RSA key pair at any time |

## Security Model

```
Password  ──► PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (260k iter) ──► AES-256 key
                                                        │
File ──────────────────────────────────────────► AES-CBC encrypt ──► .enc file
                                                        │
AES key ──► RSA-OAEP (recipient's public key) ──► embedded in .enc
```

- **No hardcoded keys** — all keys are derived from user passwords with a unique random salt
- **Salt stored per file** — each encrypted file has its own PBKDF2 salt
- **Integrity guaranteed** — SHA-256 hash verified on every decrypt
- **Passwords hashed with bcrypt** (cost factor 12)

## Usage

1. **Register** — create an account (RSA key pair generated automatically)
2. **Scan** — discover other devices running SecureShare on your network
3. **Encrypt** — select a file, choose a password and recipients
4. **Send** — transfer the `.enc` file to a peer device
5. **Decrypt** — the recipient decrypts with their password + private key
6. **Verify** — check that the file hasn't been modified since encryption

---

## Tech Stack

- **GUI** — PyQt6
- **Cryptography** — PyCryptodome (AES-256, RSA-2048, PKCS1-OAEP)
- **Key Derivation** — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (hashlib)
- **Authentication** — bcrypt
- **Server** — Flask (embedded, LAN only)
- **Discovery** — concurrent socket scanning (ThreadPoolExecutor)
